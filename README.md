# NewScientist Clone Page

Cloning a page from the New Scientist site to practice positioning elements.

This project file is from The Odin Project HTML/CSS section (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/html-and-css/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements) where we learn to position HTML elements in CSS with float, grid, and flexbox. The primary focus of the clone page is to position elements.
